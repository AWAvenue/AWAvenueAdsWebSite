## What is the AWAvenue Ads Rule?

One of the best ad filter lists in the open-source community, implementing excellent ad blocking, privacy protection, and data savings. It supports various common network-layer ad-blocking tools and proxy tools¬π. Compared to other ad rules that contain thousands of entries, the AWAvenue Ads Rule has exceptional size control, an ultra-high hit rate, and low hardware requirements.

After subscribing to this rule, you will immediately notice the annoying shake-to-skip ads disappear, subscription lists and in-article ads won't load, autoplay video ads are eradicated, boot-up ads on TV boxes/smart TVs vanish, and you'll have more available space on your phone (because ad files are blocked from being delivered).

Compared to other ad-blocking methods, this network-layer filtering approach is low-cost, easy to use, fast, and widely applicable (such as router deployment). You don‚Äôt need to configure individual apps, and it filters ads without affecting the normal use of your apps.

<br />

**As of December 2024, we can block over 90% of ad SDKs currently used in Teyvat.**

**This rule does not consider scenarios where users need to access ad rewards. Additionally, we always believe that your privacy is more important than "some small conveniences." So, please consider carefully whether to use it.**

## What are the advantages?

The advantages are clear. Here‚Äôs a comparison with other filtering methods:

### Network Layer Filtering:

AdGuard series (AdGuard, AdGuard Home, AdGuard DNS, etc.), AdAway, BlueCat, Surge, etc.

### Accessibility Layer Blocking:

xË∑≥Ë∑≥, GKD, One-Finger Zen, etc.

### Xposed Blocking:

xÂú£ÂáÄÂåñ, xÂ£ÅÊ®°Âùó, various enhanced modules that block ads in specific apps/systems, etc.
