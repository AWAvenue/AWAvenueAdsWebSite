## What are the AWAvenue Ads Rule?

The AWAvenue Ads Rule primarily use Adblock syntax to combat various ad SDKs in Android applications at the network level, preventing their loading and providing you with a clear and comfortable online experience!

<br />

**As of January 2024, we can intercept over 90% of the existing ad SDKs on the Tivat Continent.**

## What are the Advantages?

The advantages are evident when compared to the other two filtering methods:

### Network-Level Filtering:
AdGuard series (AdGuard, AdGuard Home, AdGuard DNS, etc.), AdAway, Blue Cat, Surge, etc.

### Accessibility Interception:
XJump, GKD, One Finger Zen, etc.

### Xposed Interception:
Great Sage Purification, XWall Module, various enhanced modules that intercept ads in specific applications/systems, etc.

| Feature/Filtering Method | Network-Level Filtering | Accessibility Interception | Xposed Interception |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Stability               | ðŸ’¯ Best                 | Average, but severe background killing on domestic systems | Average             |
| Compatibility           | ðŸ’¯ Best, and can be hot-updated | Average, needs adaptation, and has false positives, but almost all Android devices can use it | Poor, relies on Xposed framework (root) and requires adaptation, plus a considerable number of applications have hook detection, making it challenging to start |
| Interception Capability  | Blocks all intercepted ads across all platforms | Does not intercept, ~~like masturbation~~, ads still cache on the device, and incurs corresponding data usage | ðŸ’¯ Powerful, can hook and intercept various tricky ads |
| Response Speed           | ðŸ’¯ Excellent, everything happens in milliseconds | Slow, visible ads are commonplace | ðŸ’¯ Fastest, as it directly loads with the code |
| Applicability Range      | ðŸ’¯ Universal across all platforms | Limited to Android devices | Limited to Android devices |
| Learning Curve           | Low                     | ðŸ’¯ Minimal               | High, requires root+Xposed framework, demands a certain level of modding experience |
| Power Consumption        | ðŸ’¯ Low, if hosted on a router/server, does not consume mobile device battery | High, and requires keeping the application active in the background, with a "considerable" power consumption | Depends on the situation, more hooks mean more power consumption |
